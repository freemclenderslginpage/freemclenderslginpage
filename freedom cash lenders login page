The biggest reason those with poor credit tend to turn to short-term loans is the ease of obtaining one. But you may end up paying big for that convenience. If you can qualify for an installment loan instead, thatâ€™s almost always the better route. One of the easiest ways to find a flexible lender is through an online lending network.

Online lending networks can connect you with hundreds of lenders from across the country, increasing your chances of finding a compatible lender. While each lender will have its own specific guidelines for credit and income, most will share the same basic requirements, like needing a regular source of income and an active checking account.
