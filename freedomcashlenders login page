Some of life’s “emergencies” aren’t quite as pressing as we think. Your teenager won’t actually die without those new jeans (no matter what they insist). Some emergencies, however, are truly matters of concern — like your only car throwing a rod and needing immediate automotive surgery.

If you need a personal loan but don’t want a payday loan, you are generally looking for a personal installment loan. These loans are repaid in monthly payments and are usually much more affordable than short-term or payday loans.
